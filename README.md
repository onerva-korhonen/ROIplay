# ROIplay
A bunch of tools related to playing with Regions of Interest (ROIs). Partly a pythonization of my old MatLab code for handling voxel and ROI time series. Also an aim to avoid copypasting between projects.

The templates folder contains the MNI standard space template as well as ROI atlases (so far Brainnetome).
